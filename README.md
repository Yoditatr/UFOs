### Overview of Project

##### Our webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, and we wanted to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date. 

### Results

##### I have written a code that will create a dynamic table filters to add the city, state, country, and shape. Once user enter a search criterion based on their requirement the table will be filtered to show part of the table to meet the criteria. For Example, let us say a user wanted to see UFO sightings by shape specifically circle, they should be able to see that specific table row(s).

### Summary
(https://yoditatr.github.io/UFOs/)
##### One recommendation is that an additional function populateDropdowns() can be written to automatically populate the dropdown menus with unique values for each category. Another recommendation is that these options can be sorted in ascending order for ease of use when selecting.
